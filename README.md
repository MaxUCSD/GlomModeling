This is just a copy of essentially my notes. 

So far we've got a few things. 


```
project
│   README.md
│   all_vars.png (plot of each var, r,c,s over time in each glom)    
│   docs.md (Math notes on the glomerular modeling) 
|   environment.yml (duh)
│   glomstatespace.html (interactive 3d figure of the glom state space)
|   just_concentration.py (File for working with single diff eq (c))
|   test.py (random stuff for testing so I don't have to test in a working script)
|   toymodel_vnoaobglom.py (main script for solving system of diff eq and plotting)
```
